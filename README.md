Hi there, we're team Pasta! 🍝

Our team consists of Batchansaa, Kelly, Susan, and Sally.

While there are resources to access crisis lines and counsellors, sometimes the case is that we want to anonymously chat with a peer
who has undergone similar experiences in a safe, non-judgemental, and
informal setting that is easy to access.

Welcome Olà, a web-based, mobile-first application to find your next peer to support you or to support another peer. 💬
