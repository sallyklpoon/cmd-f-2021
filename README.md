# cmd-f-2021

Hi there, we're team Pasta! üçù

Our team consists of Batchansaa, Kelly, Susan, and Sally.

Concept: The community is diverse with experiences. We want to increase connectivity in the community and connect people's shared experiences to support mental health for marginalized groups.

While access to formal mental health supports are accessible by a quick search (crisis lines and counsellors), perhaps there is a case when all we want is to anonymously chat with a peer who has undergone similar experiences in a safe, non-judgmental, and informal setting that is easy to access.

Welcome Ol√†, our mobile-first web application design, aiming to allow 'Sharers' to connect and find peers who share similar experiences anonymously.

*This project was submitted to MLHacks cmd-f 2021 hackathon where our group has chosen to have NwPlus hacks tonate $50 on our behalf to Vancouver's Downtown Eastside Women's Shelter.*
